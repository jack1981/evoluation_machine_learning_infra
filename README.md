## Books recommendations
- [Design Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) - A gem of 2022 in Machine Learning System Design. It will introduce you to the entire Machine Learning Lifecycle and prepare you for further deep dives
- [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) - ML and MLOps Engineers are meant to bring Software Engineering practices to the Data Science world. After reading this book you will understand DevOps practices in and out
- [Machine Learning Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns-Preparation/dp/1098115783) - The book introduces you to 30 Design Patterns for Machine Learning. You will find 30 recurring real life problems in ML Systems, how a given pattern tries to solve them and what are the alternatives. Always have this book by your side and refer to it once you run into described problems - the book is gold
- [Team Topologies](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819) - As ML or MLOps Engineer you might be placed into different types of teams. It could be ML Platform Team, Stream Aligned cross-functional Team or an Enabling Team. After reading this book - you will understand the purpose of these different Team Types and what the most efficient communication patterns between them are
- [nfrastructure as Code](https://www.amazon.com/Infrastructure-Code-Dynamic-Systems-Cloud/dp/1098114671) - This is the area that I see under-looked most when it comes to ML and MLOps Engineers. Most of the time you would be working in the cloud and your day-to-day would include a lot of IaaC, especially if you are part of a ML Platform Team. Learning IaaC will give you the edge in today's competitive markets
